## üí° My Philosophy & Approach

* **Coding Principles:** I strive to implement clean architecture and good programming practices, alongside fostering clear communication. I have experience with and have studied methodologies like Scrum, Agile, and information security.
* **Problem Solving:** I am a strong believer in breaking down roles for members of the team to tackle head-on. Piece by piece, team effort is a necessity.
